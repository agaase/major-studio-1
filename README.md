#### How does Conflict affect Inequality in Africa?

Countries in Africa have gone through a number of conflicts since their independence from colonial rule.  Violence due  to conflicts not only results in deaths and destruction of property, but a greater collateral damage leading to a complete breakdown of society. With this visualization, I try to understand different drivers of societal inequality due to conflict violence.

 > I am studying the nature of ethnic conflicts in sub-saharan africa because I want to find out what are the different types of conflicts and what causes them in order to understand how the nature of conflicts hamper the growth and inequality of a country or in this case the whole SSA. I am using variables related to conflicts such as type of conflict, duration and intensity. My visualization is based on [Uppsala Conflict Data Program] (http://ucdp.uu.se/) data.

#### Causes and Impact of Conflicts in Africa : What have Scholars researched?

With this project I try to understand what kind of research academic scholars have carried out around conflicts in Africa specifically related to its impact and cause. For this I analyse top 1000 search results from  [Google Academic Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=africa+conflict&hl=en&as_sdt=1,33&as_ylo=1960&as_yhi=2010&as_vis=1) for each year between 1970-2016. Each search result is analysed for its headline to understand its focus which is ultimately aggregated with all other results to find a larger focus over a time period.

 > I am studying the Google Scholar results (e.g [here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=980&q=africa+conflict&hl=en&as_sdt=1,33&as_ylo=1960&as_yhi=1960&as_vis=1)) on the search keyword - "Africa and Conflict" because I want to find out what research was done over the years on that topic in order to know what were the impacts and causes of conflicts in Africa as perceived by the research community. I am using variables related to conflicts such as crisis, war, ethnicity, coup etc to  make my results more relevant.
