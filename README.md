#### How does Conflict affect Inequality in Africa?

Countries in Africa have gone through a number of conflicts since their independence from colonial rule.  Violence due  to conflicts not only results in deaths and destruction of property, but a greater collateral damage leading to a complete breakdown of society. With this visualization, I try to understand different drivers of societal inequality due to conflict violence.

#### Causes and Impact of Conflicts in Africa : What have Scholars researched?

With this project I try to understand what kind of research academic scholars have carried out around conflicts in Africa specifically related to its impact and cause. For this I analyse top 1000 search results from  [Google Academic Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=africa+conflict&hl=en&as_sdt=1,33&as_ylo=1960&as_yhi=2010&as_vis=1) for each year between 1970-2016. Each search result is analysed for its headline to understand its focus which is ultimately aggregated with all other results to find a larger focus over a time period.
